# CodiceFiscale
An Android application to calculate the Italian tax code (Codice Fiscale).
I created this app when I was in my first year of college, and I only quickly revised the code before uploading it, so it will not be perfect.
The list of municipalities is taken from [http://lab.comuni-italiani.it/](http://lab.comuni-italiani.it/)
